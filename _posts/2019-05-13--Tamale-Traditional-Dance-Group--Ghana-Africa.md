If you're in Tamale, you can see some West African Dance and Drumming at the Tamale Cultural Center on most weekdays around 4 or 5 pm. There is a group meeting on these days for practice and visitors are welcome to watch and to enjoy the performance.

And if you're got some rhythm in your blood you might can join them after the practice :) But we weren't one of them. We walked into the group by chance. We heard some drumming from the main street and followed the sound.

We're going to write about this Traditional Dance and Drumming Group soon on our [Ghana Travel Blog](https://ghana.for91days.com/).

This video was filmed with [this camera](https://for91days.com/go/gimbal19).
