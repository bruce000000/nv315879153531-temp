In this report, I cover the early market action from London on Monday, May 13th, 2019. I look briefly at the precious metals, the stock market, the dollar, the bond market and the price of WTI and Brent crude oil.

With all the headlines and talk about Trade Wars and the stock market I think it is important to point out that the main culprit behind the Boom and Bust cycles of the last one hundred years has been the Central Bank or the Federal Reserve System.

In this report, I will show how the Fed's manipulation and control of interest rates have been the major drivers behind the accentuated business cycles created by the Central Bank.

My conclusion is that we should not fall for the mainstream and Wall Street propaganda that will most probably blame the Trade War or dispute between the U.S. and China for the next financial crisis and economic recession.
