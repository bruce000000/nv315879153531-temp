Hi friends,

This is my day# 57 contribution for Seven77 challenge lead by [@Nathanmars](https://steemit.com/@Nathanmars)

# Decentralisation is the future and STEEM is decentralised and another good news is that BTC has crossed 7k price mark. 

Together we are working to make STEEM worth 7.77 $ this year. Please be a part of the campaign and enjoy the journey.

It's humble request to everyone to join this campaign.

It's our blockchain and we all should come together to promote it. Entire seven77 community is working with Amazing man Nathanmars to make Steem worth 7.77 $ this year.

Thanks brother [@nathanmars](https://steemit.com/@nathanmars) for your dedication and amazing work for Steem community.

Thank you.
