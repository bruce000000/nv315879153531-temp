Hello Steemians,

As you may know I am coming to the end of my push-ups challenge for seven77. I am about to achieve my goal and I am very excited. 

But what happens next?

I have realized whilst I am about to achieve my  goal that I set a few months back , I am all of a sudden going to be left without a goal or a direction. 

Is all this momentum I have built up going to be wasted? Surely not! 

I have realised just in time that I need to start planning my next thing I am going to build upon steem.

Planning, building and long term thinking is what will help us carry our momentum on.

So achieve those goals, but don't forget to have another goal in place before you finish your current one.

Have an awesome day everyone.
