my new record in the new season! unfortunately I could not win 
there would be more frags


I invite you to watch my first game in the new season. The new map looks really interesting. The creators have added many new things and one new weapon.
I like fortnite because the creators are constantly working on the game and improving it.
They have many ideas for the future of the game. keep it up!
If you like my game, I invite you to watch my channel!
