I spent a day at the state park exploring the river, trails and the Manchester Mill Ruins. I was joined by a geologist of the State Park and we walked around for a few hours seeing the park and talking about its stone formations and how they probably happened a very long time ago.

This footage is from my SJCAM, I split up my footage on this video so its only the visual light video being shown here. I did another video with my special camera using Infrared and Ultraviolet passthrough fitlers.
