What's up everybody?

From today, I am adding cycling to my daily routine.
Skateboarding is a very tough and tiresome sport and it requires very good physical shape.

As I grow older, I am starting to realize that I can't just skate.It's too brutal for my body.
I need to exercise more and be in a much better shape if I want to continue skating the way I do now.
So I chose cycling as my 2nd hobby.
I could easily start running but I already absorb shocks from skating so thank you, I do not want more on my knees.

Anyway, I cycled around 14 km today in 1 hour and I feel proud about my first day.
I didn't expect cycling to be so tiresome to my knees but I guess I'll get used to it.
I will not be uploading vlogs from my morning training, just daily photos so you can swear me if I don't cicle for one day, allright? Hehe

Thank you all for watching and supporting me and if you want to see cool skateboarding posts check out @Steemskate.
Much love and I wish you a great and creative week.
Cheers.
