Kind of like the Great British Bake Off... but Steem Sister Style.

It's cooking week on SSS and we *both* think we have the best guacamole - so we decided to put it to the test! We actually did a *blind* test - were we taste test it separately on camera. We wish you all could have been there to taste test it with us - but we figured this was the most unbiased way we could run it. We even had a cameo appearance by my boyfriend who helped with the taste testing. Except he didn't want to be on camera so you only see his hands. ðŸ˜‚
