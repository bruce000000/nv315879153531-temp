Yesterday I had a nice conversation with @themonetaryfew and he warned me about my emotional investing in Steem.

These things usually don't go together and he is right. Emotions and investing don't mix.

One of the subjects that came up is that I should have powered down in the past.

I gave it some thought and answered him but this morning I also felt it would make a nice topic for a vlog and explain my reasoning.

I'm currently a buyer of Steem and believe in this blockchain more than ever before.

I talk about this and many other things in one of the longest vlogs I ever made.
