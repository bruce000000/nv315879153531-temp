We had a rare family day out, thanks to my lovely wife's making us all get out the house. We're so blessed to live where we do and we rarely take advantage of it as a family, which is a real shame. We'll definitely get back up there again later in the year for some swimming.

Hi, I'm Cams, a music teacher on the Isle of Arran in Scotland. I've been playing guitar since 1991 and gigging for over 15 years. I teach privately at my home on Arran and enjoy making video lessons and podcasts about the guitar world. I am what could safely be called a guitar geek!  

If you want to know more about me and my instruments, check out http://acousticguitar.io and http://camsmusic.net
