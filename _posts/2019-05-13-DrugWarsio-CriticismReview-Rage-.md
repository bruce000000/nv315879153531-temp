Skip to 5:38 for the "Gameplay" 

I gave DrugWars a try! Sadly I had to wait 2+ hours to start playing. Unlucky I guess. Let the player try the game, get addicted, THEN have them wait or pay to not wait. I can't imagine the number of players who opened this game then never came back. This can be remedied by simply lowering the timers at the start of the game OR adding a few more buildings to buy in the very beginning just to give you a taste of the game. 

On a serious note, I didn't mean for this to be so negative but I was really excited to try this game then when I saw the FIRST wait timer was set to 2+ hours my excitement was replaced with rage. 

I believe dapps like this have massive potential if the are done right. They are insanely appealing (play game, get crypto) but in execution they seem to be majorly lacking.
