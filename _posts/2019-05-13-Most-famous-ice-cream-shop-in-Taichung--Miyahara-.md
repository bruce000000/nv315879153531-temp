Visited this famous ice cream shop the other day. It was an eye clinic owned by a Japanese doctor Miyahara back in time. The building is well maintained, you can feel the vintage 1940s vibes everywhere. 

Now the building functions as souvenir shops selling traditional Taiwanese and Japanese cookies. But it is more famous for its ice cream shop, I also tasted their ice cream of course.
