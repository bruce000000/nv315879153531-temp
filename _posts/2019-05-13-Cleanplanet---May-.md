Hello Friends
Good Morning
Hope all are well and enjoying your time in dtube.

My name is Arafat. I live in Dinajpur district of Rangpur division of Bangladesh.

The present video has shot on our House zone. There was a ton of soil in the section of this zone, which was hurting the arable land. An older man asked me, what you are doing that's? At that point I clarified him about clean planet.

Today I am share My 47th cleanplanet post in dtube.

Thank you
