These few days I've been really surfing the daaps, mostly the Tron daaps. Some say its a gambling where you can double your earnings, but there is a risk associated with it. I've already tried the daaps of Steem network, it was quite impressive. So now Im little bit of researching on Tron daaps. I will let you guys know everything of what I've learned.

Thank you for watching.
