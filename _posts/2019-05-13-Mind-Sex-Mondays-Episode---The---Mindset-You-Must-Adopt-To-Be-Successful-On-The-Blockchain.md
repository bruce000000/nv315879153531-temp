## <center>Welcome to episode 14 of my weekly video podcast series, Mind Sex Mondays</center>

### <center>In this weekly series, I will present topics, that many of us may accept as foundational to our realities, and belief structures, that upon close scrutiny, don't hold up.</center>

<center>*If you are sensitive about your belief system, and version of reality, then this series may well not be for you.*</center>

### <center>As always, please let me know your thoughts, in the comments below, or as a video, and link it, in the comments below.</center>

# <center>Think, Believe, Achieve.</center>

## <center>Peace.</center>
