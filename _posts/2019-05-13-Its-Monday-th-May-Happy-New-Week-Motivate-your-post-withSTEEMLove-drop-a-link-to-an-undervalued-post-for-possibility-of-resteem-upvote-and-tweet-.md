# Hello lovelies! It’s Monday 13th May! Happy NEW WEEK? What are your plans for the week?

It is nice and sunny this morning. I’ve been steeming, freewriting and catching up on a few things. Later I will be watching Ep5 of GOT. 

I am reading @byn’s new book *365 Marks On The Wall*, I am a quarter of the way through and it is very gripping. I will do a proper review once I have finished, but I can recommend it based on what I have read so far. If you want to check out other reviews, have a look at @byn’s post https://steemit.com/fiction/@byn/a-book-review-made-me-cry. 

I am also reading through the stories for the next @steemfiction book (theme: MURDER). You guys are in for a treat! My story is pretty much finished and edited now.

How are you guys doing in your mission to help #GrowTheFreewriteHouse? You do know you could win 500sp for a month by helping, don’t you? https://steemit.com/growthefreewritehouse/@freewritehouse/help-growthefreewritehouse-and-win-a-delegation-of-500sp-for-a-month-time-to-write-your-post

Hope you have a fantastic day, my friends… Steem on!

Motivate your post with #STEEMlove!  Drop a link in the comments and I'll check it out. If I like it I'll resteem and tweet it. If I love it, I'll upvote it too. If you are too shy to drop a link just leave a lovely comment and I will go and check out your profile, if I see something I like I’ll resteem that! :)

<center><sup>@steemfiction - *Voices In The Darkness*: 8 supernatural tales by 8 Writers from the STEEM Blockchain</sup></center>

Have you heard of #STEEMfiction? @steemfiction are a collection of writers (led by @jeezzle) on the steem blockchain, and we published a book! https://steemit.com/steem/@steemfiction/steem-fiction-s-first-short-story-anthology-is-now-available-on-amazon-com-voices-in-the-darkness-tales-from-the-steem

Please could you help us by following @steemfiction? We'd like the book to succeed for Steem as much as for us! 

# **Voices In The Darkness** is now ALSO available as a paperback!

If you want a taster of what is in the book, the video below shows me reading the first 900 words, or so, of my story, *The Tell-Tale Dead*
