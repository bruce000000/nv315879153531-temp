There are reasons as to why people can't make decisions and this is due to psychological incertitude/ineptitude, now it's really not because making decisions are difficult or because they're too weak to make it, it is because sometimes there's always a realistic tendency and an emotional tendency and people tend to embrace their emotional side instead of their realistic side,
That is the heart and the mind are two important member of a person's wholeness, and that's why sometimes people allow empathy, love, joy to take over a huge part to their decision-making and when decision-making are made based on emotion/setiments there is always a tendency that people will walk two steps backward and one step forward because they didn't embrace the realist aspect they should no matter how less endearing it may be.
